        <p>Load up on guns, bring your friends
            It's fun to lose and to pretend
            She's over bored and self assured
            Oh no, I know a dirty word</p>

        <p>
            Hello, hello, hello, how low
            Hello, hello, hello, how low
            Hello, hello, hello, how low
            Hello, hello, hello

            Thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder
            Thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder

            I was caught
            In the middle of a railroad track (thunder)
            I looked 'round
            And I knew there was no turning back (thunder)
            My mind raced
            And I thought, what could I do? (Thunder)
            And I knew
            There was no help, no help from you (thunder)
            Sound of the drums
            Beating in my heart
            The thunder of guns
            Tore me apart
            You've been
            Thunderstruck 
        </p>
