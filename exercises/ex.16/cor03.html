    <h2>Welcome To The Jungle</h2>
        <p>Oh my god Jump
            Welcome to the jungle, we've got fun and games
            We got everything you want honey, we know the names
            We are the people that can find whatever you may need
            If you got the money, honey, we got your disease</p>
        <p>In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
            Watch it bring you to your sha-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n knees, knees
            Mwah, I, I wanna watch you bleed</p>
    <h2>Paradise City</h2>
        <p>Take me down to the paradise city
            Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
            Take me home (oh, won't you please take me home)
            Take me down to the paradise city
            Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
            Take me home (oh, won't you please take me home)</p>
        <p>Just a urchin livin' under the street
            I'm a hard case that's tough to beat
            I'm your charity case so buy me something to eat
            I'll pay you at another time
            Take it to the end of the line</p>
    <h2>Sweet Child O' Mine</h2>
        <p>She's got a smile that it seems to me
            Reminds me of childhood memories
            Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
            Now and then when I see her face
            She takes me away to that special place
            And if I stare too long, I'd probably break down and cry</p>
        <p>Whoa, oh, oh
            Sweet child o' mine
            Whoa, oh, oh, oh
            Sweet love of mine</p>
