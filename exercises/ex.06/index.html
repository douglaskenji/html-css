    <h1>Song</h1>
    <h2>Nirvana</h2>
    <h3>Come as you are</h3>
    <p>Come as you are, as you were
        As I want you to be
        As a friend, as a friend
        As an old enemy</p>
    <h3>Lithium</h3>
    <p>I'm so happy 'cause today I found my friends
        They're in my head
        I'm so ugly, that's okay, 'cause so are you
        Broke our mirrors
        Sunday morning is everyday, for all I care
        And I'm not scared
        Light my candles in a daze
        'Cause I've found God</p>
        <h2>AC/DC</h2>
    <h3>Highway to hell</h3>
    <p>Livin' easy
        Lovin' free
        Season ticket on a one way ride
        Askin' nothin'
        Leave me be
        Takin' everythin' in my stride
        Don't need reason
        Don't need rhyme
        Ain't nothin' that I'd rather do
        Goin' down
        Party time
        My friends are gonna be there too</p>
