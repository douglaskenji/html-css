    <h1>Billie Eilish, Your Power</h1>
    <p>Try not to abuse your power
        I know we didn't choose to change
        You might not wanna lose your power
        But havin' it's so strange</p>
    <p>She said you were a hero
        You played the part
        But you ruined her in a year
        Don't act like it was hard
        And you swear you didn't know (didn't know)
        No wonder why you didn't ask
        She was sleepin' in your clothes (in your clothes)
        But now she's got to get to class</p>
    <p>How dare you?
        And how could you?
        Will you only feel bad when they find out?
        If you could take it all back
        Would you?</p>
