    <p>Loaded like a freight train
        Flyin' like an aeroplane
        Feelin' like a space brain
        One more time tonight (look out)</p>
    <p>Well, I'm a west coast struttin'
        One bad mother
        Got a rattlesnake suitcase under my arm
        Said I'm a mean machine
        Been drinkin' gasoline
        And honey you can make my motor hum</p>
    <p>I got one chance left
        In a nine live cat
        I got a dog eat dog sly smile
        I got a molotov cocktail with a match to go
        I smoke my cigarette with style
        And I can tell you honey
        You can make my money tonight</p>
    <p>Wake up late, honey put on your clothes
        And take your credit card to the liquor store
        Well that's one for you and two for me by tonight</p>
    <p>I'll be loaded like a freight train
        Flyin' like an aeroplane
        Feelin' like a space brain
        One more time tonight</p>
