    <h1>Guns N' Roses, Rocket Queen</h1>
    <p>If I say I don't need anyone
        I can say these things to you
        'Cause I can turn on anyone
        Just like I've turned on you
        
        I've got a tongue like a razor
        A sweet switchblade knife
        And I can do you favors
        But then you'll do whatever I like
        
        Here I am
        And you're a Rocket Queen
        I might be a little young
        But honey, I ain't naive
        
        Here I am
        And you're a Rocket Queen, oh, yeah
        I might be too much
        But honey, you're a bit obscene
        
        I've seen everything imaginable
        Pass before these eyes
        I've had everything that's tangible
        Honey, you'd be surprised
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm a sexual innuendo
        In this burned out paradise
        If you turn me on to anything
        You better turn me on tonight
        
        Here I am
        And you're a Rocket Queen
        I might be a little young
        But honey, I ain't naive
        
        Here I am
        And you're a Rocket Queen, oh, yeah
        I might be too much
        But honey, you're a bit obscene
        
        Here I am
        And you're a Rocket Queen
        I might be a little young
        But honey, I ain't naive
        
        Here I am
        And you're a Rocket Queen, oh, yeah
        I might be too much
        But honey, you're a bit obscene
        
        I see you standing
        Standing on your own
        It's such a lonely place for you
        For you to be
        
        If you need a shoulder
        Or if you need a friend
        I'll be here standing
        Until the bitter end
        
        No one needs the sorrow
        No one needs the pain
        I hate to see you
        Walking out there
        Out in the rain
        
        So don't chastise me
        Or think I, I mean you harm
        Or those that take you
        Leave you strung out
        Much too far
        Baby, yeah
        
        Don't ever leave me
        Say you'll always be there
        All I ever wanted
        Was for you
        To know that I care</p>
