    <h1>Nirvana</h1>
    <h2>In Bloom</h2> 
    <p>Sell the kids for food
        Weather changes moods
        Spring is here again
        Reproductive glands</p>
    <p>He's the one
        Who likes all our pretty songs
        And he likes to sing along
        And he likes to shoot his gun
        But he knows not what it means
        Knows not what it means
        And I say he's the one
        Who likes all our pretty songs
        And he likes to sing along
        And he likes to shoot his gun
        But he knows not what it means
        Knows not what it means
        And I say yeah</p>
    <p>We can have some more
        Nature is a whore
        Bruises on the fruit
        Tender age in bloom</p>
