   <h1>Nirvana</h1> 
   <h2>Smells Like Teen Spirit</h2>
   <p>Load up on guns, bring your friends
    It's fun to lose and to pretend
    She's over bored and self assured
    Oh no, I know a dirty word</p>
   <p>Hello, hello, hello, how low
    Hello, hello, hello, how low
    Hello, hello, hello, how low
    Hello, hello, hello</p>
   <p>With the lights out, it's less dangerous
    Here we are now, entertain us
    I feel stupid and contagious
    Here we are now, entertain us
    A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido
    Yeah, hey</p>
   <p>Yay</p>
   <p>I'm worse at what I do best
    And for this gift I feel blessed
    Our little group has always been
    And always will until the end</p>
