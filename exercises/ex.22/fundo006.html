        <h2>In Bloom</h2>
        <p>Sell the kids for food
            Weather changes moods
            Spring is here again
            Reproductive glands
            He's the one
            Who likes all our pretty songs
            And he likes to sing along
            And he likes to shoot his gun
            But he knows not what it means
            Knows not what it means
            And I say he's the one
            Who likes all our pretty songs
            And he likes to sing along
            And he likes to shoot his gun
            But he knows not what it means
            Knows not what it means
            And I say yeah
            We can have some more
            Nature is a whore
            Bruises on the fruit
            Tender age in bloom
            He's the one
            Who likes all our pretty songs
            And he likes to sing along
            And he likes to shoot his gun
            But he knows not what it means
            Knows not what it means
